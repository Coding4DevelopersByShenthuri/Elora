  "transcript": "This is Global Newsline with Elena Park. We begin in Toronto, where delegates from 50 countries have convened for the Global Climate Innovation Summit. Engineers unveiled a tandem solar cell that just cleared the 38 percent efficiency mark, a formidable jump over conventional silicon panels. Energy ministers toured a demonstration micogrid that links rooftop arrays with second-life electric vehicle batteries, signaling how cities may reach net-zero targets without building new fossil plants. \n\nTurning to markets, the Bank of Canada held its benchmark rate at 5.0 percent for a fifth consecutive meeting. The central bank cited easing consumer inflation but warned that rent and groceries are still rising too fast for comfort. A fresh jobs report showed modest gains, though hospitality employers scaled back hours ahead of shoulder season. Analysts say the pause gives indebted households breathing room while investors monitor wage growth. \n\nWe head now to Western Australia, where firefighters are battling a fast-moving blaze sparked by dry lightning. Officials kept the highest alert in place as winds shifted toward coastal towns. Aerial tankers painted orange fire retardant along a 60-kilometer front while volunteer crews escorted residents to evacuation shelters. Authorities urged people to prepare three-day go bags, reminding viewers that late-night evacuations are often chaotic. \n\nIn health news, researchers at St. Martha’s Hospital debuted an artificial intelligence screening tool for early lung cancer detection. The software reviews CT scan patterns and cut false positives by thirty-three percent in a 4,000-patient trial, meaning fewer invasive biopsies. Clinicians say the program doesn’t replace radiologists; instead, it flags anomalies so doctors can focus on complex cases. The hospital plans to license the technology to community clinics next year if regulatory approvals stay on track. \n\nArts correspondent Diego Ramos takes us to Paris, where a new documentary chronicles the painstaking restoration of Notre-Dame Cathedral. The film reveals artisans replicating gargoyles with 3D-printed molds, while historians debate how closely the new spire should match architect Viollet-le-Duc’s 19th-century design. The director weaves in interviews with firefighters who risked their lives the night of the 2019 blaze, offering a moving portrait of cultural resilience. \n\nSports anchor Maya Greene reports that national soccer captain Lila Sørensen is retiring after securing Denmark’s first World Cup medal. Sørensen cited chronic knee injuries but promised to mentor young women entering the academy system. Fans flooded social media with highlight reels, and Copenhagen City Hall plans a farewell ceremony next week. \n\nWe close in Nairobi, where a youth robotics team returned home with top honors from the Pan-African STEM Challenge. The high schoolers designed a robot that uses infrared signatures to sort plastic waste, tackling one of the city’s biggest landfill problems. Their trip almost fell through when airfare doubled, but a last-minute crowdfunding campaign raised twenty thousand dollars in four days. Standing on the airport tarmac, the students encouraged girls to join next year’s competition, reminding us that innovation thrives when communities rally together. That’s the latest from Global Newsline. I’m Elena Park—thanks for watching.",
