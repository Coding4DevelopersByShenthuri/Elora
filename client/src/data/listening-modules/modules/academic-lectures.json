  "transcript": "Good afternoon, everyone. Today we are zooming out from the component level and looking at the energy transition through an interdisciplinary lens. This course sits at the intersection of climate policy, electrical engineering, and applied data science. That means we care about molecules and markets, transformers and tax credits. Our core question is deceptively simple: how do we electrify everything while keeping the global temperature increase near 1.5 degrees Celsius? \n\nWe will begin with a reality check. According to the International Energy Agency, solar and wind supplied four-fifths of new global electricity capacity in 2023. Yet fossil fuels still provide over 60 percent of total generation. Efficiency is indispensable, but it is not sufficient. To reach net-zero by mid-century we must simultaneously deploy renewables, modernize grids, and rewire incentives. This year the IPCC’s AR6 report reminded us that every tenth of a degree matters, so think of today’s lecture as a toolkit for pragmatic optimism. \n\nLet’s unpack three pillars: finance, hardware, and data. On finance, many of you asked about risk premiums in emerging markets. The most exciting developments are happening inside blended finance stacks which braid concessional capital, philanthropic guarantees, and commercial investors. When the African Development Bank backstops currency risk, private developers can finally build battery storage outside coastal capitals. I want you to read the Convergence report posted on Canvas and identify one blended structure that could work for your capstone city. \n\nOn hardware, let’s talk storage. Lithium-ion remains the workhorse for vehicles, but grid planners are experimenting with long-duration iron-air chemistry and thermal storage reservoirs. These technologies can absorb multi-day wind lulls without resorting to diesel peaker plants. Pay attention to permitting bottlenecks: we often treat grid congestion as an engineering failure, when in fact the holdup lives inside a 600-page environmental review. Bureaucratic drag is measurable. In the assignment you’ll quantify how many clean megawatts are stranded because of interconnection queues. \n\nNow for data. We cannot manage what we do not measure, so I am pointing you toward three open datasets. First, the U.S. Residential Electrification Survey for household adoption patterns of heat pumps and induction stoves. Second, the European Network of Transmission System Operators dataset for congestion pricing signals. Third, the Global Power Plant Database for geospatial cross-checking. Blend these with proprietary sources if you have access, but document every transformation step because reproducibility is part of your grade. \n\nCase study time. Last semester a team partnered with a public housing authority to evaluate deep retrofits. They used smart-meter data, compared pre- and post-intervention bills, and layered in health department records. The outcome was striking: indoor air quality improved, emergency-room asthma visits declined, and residents saved an average of thirty dollars per month. That is the kind of co-benefit analysis that persuades policymakers. \n\nBefore we close, a few housekeeping notes. Your policy memo, due in two weeks, should evaluate at least two contrasting instruments—perhaps a clean energy standard versus performance-based tax credits. Next Friday we are hosting an optional workshop on cleaning grid interconnection data; I strongly recommend attending if your project touches transmission. Office hours are hybrid this week, and I will post the recording of today’s lecture tonight. Remember, the energy transition is not a single technology or headline. It is a choreography of finance, hardware, people, and code. Your job in this class is to keep all of those beats in view. See you Wednesday.",
