  "transcript": "Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining today's quarterly review meeting. I'd like to start by discussing our sales performance over the past three months. We've seen a significant 25% increase in our quarterly sales, which is excellent news. This growth has been driven primarily by our new marketing initiatives and strong customer engagement. Moving forward, our next phase will focus on expansion in the European market. However, I should mention that we'll need additional budget approval for this new project. The finance team is currently reviewing our proposal, and we expect to hear back by next week. The marketing team has been working diligently on a new digital strategy for Q4, which we believe will further accelerate our growth. Our European expansion plan targets all of Western Europe as the initial market. While we're still in the negotiation phase for key partnerships, we're optimistic about the opportunities ahead. The project timeline suggests a phased launch in Q1 of next year, with 8-10 team members assigned to this initiative. We do have previous experience operating in select European countries, which gives us confidence in this venture. Once we receive budget approval, our immediate next step will be finalizing partnerships with local companies. Our success metrics will include market penetration and customer acquisition rates. We'll be tracking these closely to ensure we meet our strategic objectives. I'd like to open the floor for questions and discussion about any of these points.",
