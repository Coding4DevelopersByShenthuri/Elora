  "transcript": "Recruiter Screen – 15 minutes: “Hi Maya, thanks for joining. I’m Priya, recruiting for the Senior Product Manager opening.” They review her background leading onboarding products. Maya shares that her last launch pushed completion from 71 to 92 percent in one quarter by clarifying copy and trimming steps. Priya probes for salary expectations and explains the company’s geographic salary bands for hybrid employees. Maya signals a range but says she is open to the complete compensation picture. \n\nPanel Interview – 45 minutes: Maya meets Product Director Leo, Engineering Manager Noor, and Design Lead Sloane. Leo asks, “Tell us about a time you handled conflicting feedback.” Maya recalls a disagreement between design and analytics about experiment scope. She hosted a joint session, mapped decisions with a RACI chart, and reframed the debate around success metrics rather than personal preference. Noor asks how Maya ensures technical debt stays visible; she describes a quarterly “maintenance sprint” that she co-created with engineering. The panel leans in when she explains how she reports outcomes, citing a 27% drop in activation time and a 40% reduction in support tickets. \n\nLive Case Study – 30 minutes: The product director presents data on rising same-day cancellations inside the company’s marketplace app. Maya clarifies the hypothesis, requests activation cohort data, customer support tags, and push notification logs. She notices cancellations spike when users see a vague service-fee message. Her solution: test clearer fee explanations plus a countdown timer before cancellation. She outlines a two-week A/B test, defines leading indicators, and flags dependencies with design and legal. The panel appreciates that she asks for guardrails—“What would success look like for you if we only reduce cancellations by five percent?” \n\nLeadership Culture Chat – 20 minutes: Two senior leaders join to discuss values. They emphasize “radical transparency,” explaining that roadmaps, OKRs, and slack channels are public by default. Maya asks how feedback travels upward. Leaders describe monthly listening sessions and anonymous surveys. She shares a time she pushed for accessibility prioritization, aligning with their inclusion goals. \n\nWrap-Up – 10 minutes: Priya returns to answer logistical questions about relocation support, start dates, and the interview timeline. She encourages Maya to email any follow-ups. That evening Maya writes personalized thank-you notes: one to Leo referencing the marketplace case, another to Noor about maintenance sprints, and one to Sloane about inclusive design patterns. She reiterates her excitement and the specific ways she could contribute to onboarding and retention metrics.",
