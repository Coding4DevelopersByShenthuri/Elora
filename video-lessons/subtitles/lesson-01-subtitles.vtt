00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Have you ever felt nervous greeting someone in a professional setting? Today, you'll master professional greetings that will boost your confidence in business situations.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In this lesson, we'll cover three essential scenarios:
First, formal greetings for business meetings.
Second, introducing yourself professionally.
And third, appropriate ways to say goodbye.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
These skills are crucial for job interviews, networking events, and daily workplace interactions.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's start with formal greetings. In business settings, you want to sound professional and confident.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here are the most common formal greetings:

'Good morning' - used before noon
'Good afternoon' - used from noon until about 5 PM
'Good evening' - used after 5 PM

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Notice how we say 'Good morning' with emphasis on 'Good' and 'morning'. Let's practice this together.

[PAUSE FOR SPEAKING EXERCISE]

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, I'll say each greeting. Repeat after me.

'Good morning' [PAUSE]

'Good afternoon' [PAUSE]

'Good evening' [PAUSE]

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Great! Notice the stress pattern - we emphasize 'Good' in all three greetings.

[PAUSE FOR SHADOW SPEAKING]

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, let's learn how to introduce yourself professionally.

The most common phrase is:
'I'm [Your Name]. It's a pleasure to meet you.'

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Or slightly more formal:
'Hello, I'm [Your Name]. Nice to meet you.'

Watch my facial expression - I'm making eye contact and smiling.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is important in professional settings.

[PAUSE FOR SPEAKING EXERCISE]

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Let's see a complete introduction in context:

**Person A**: 'Good morning!'
**Person B**: 'Good morning! I'm Sarah. Nice to meet you.'
**Person A**: 'Nice to meet you too, Sarah. I'm Michael.'

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Notice how both people maintain eye contact and speak clearly. Let's practice this dialogue together.

[PAUSE FOR DIALOGUE PRACTICE]

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.000
When ending a professional conversation, you have several options:

For formal situations:
'It was a pleasure meeting you.'
'Thank you for your time.'
'Have a great day.'

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:30.000
For slightly less formal:
'Nice meeting you!'
'Take care!'
'See you soon!'

Let's practice the formal goodbye.

[PAUSE FOR SPEAKING EXERCISE]

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Let me share common mistakes learners make:

**Mistake 1**: Saying 'Hi' in very formal settings
**Better**: Use 'Hello' or 'Good morning'

00:03:45.000 --> 00:04:00.000
**Mistake 2**: Speaking too fast
**Better**: Speak slowly and clearly

**Mistake 3**: Forgetting to smile
**Better**: A warm smile shows confidence

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Remember, in professional settings, clarity and confidence matter more than speed.

[PAUSE FOR QUIZ]

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Let's see a complete professional greeting in a real office scenario:

**Receptionist**: 'Good morning! How can I help you?'
**Visitor**: 'Good morning! I'm John Smith. I have a 10 AM appointment with Ms. Johnson.'
**Receptionist**: 'Nice to meet you, Mr. Smith. Please take a seat.'

00:04:45.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Notice the professional tone and clear pronunciation.
