Have you ever sat in a business meeting, wanting to contribute but unsure how to express your ideas in English? Today, you'll master essential phrases for participating in meetings, giving presentations, and making your voice heard professionally.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In this lesson, we'll cover four critical meeting skills:

First, participating actively in discussions and sharing ideas.
Second, agreeing and disagreeing professionally.
Third, interrupting politely and asking clarifying questions.
And fourth, giving effective presentations with clear structure.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
These skills will help you contribute confidently and professionally in any business meeting.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's start with participating in discussions. Here are powerful phrases to share your ideas:

**Opening Your Turn**:
'I'd like to add something...'
'If I could make a point...'
'I have something to contribute...'
'Can I share my thoughts on this?'

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:15.000
**Sharing Your Opinion**:
'In my opinion, [idea].'
'From my experience, [observation].'
'I believe that [idea].'
'My view is that [perspective].'

**Supporting Your Point**:
'For example, [example].'
'Let me give you an example: [example].'
'To illustrate this point: [illustration].'

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:30.000
**Building on Others' Ideas**:
'That's a great point. I'd like to add...'
'Building on what [Name] said, I think...'
'Following up on [Name]'s idea, we could...'
'I agree, and we should also consider...'

Practice these phrases to participate actively in meetings.

Learning to agree and disagree professionally is crucial in business meetings.

**Agreeing**:
'I completely agree with [Name].'
'That's an excellent point.'
'I think you're absolutely right.'
'I'm in agreement with that approach.'

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
**Partial Agreement**:
'I see your point, but I also think...'
'That's true, however we should consider...'
'I agree with [aspect], but I'm concerned about [aspect].'

**Disagreeing Professionally** (IMPORTANT):
'I see what you're saying, but I have a different perspective.'
'I understand your point, however I think...'

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:15.000
'I respectfully disagree. I believe...'
'That's one way to look at it, but from my experience...'

**Key Rule**: Always acknowledge the other person's point before disagreeing. This shows respect and professionalism.

Sometimes you need to interrupt or ask questions during meetings. Here's how to do it professionally:

**Interrupting Politely**:
'Sorry to interrupt, but I have a question.'
'Excuse me, could I add something?'
'If I could just jump in here...'
'May I interject for a moment?'

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:45.000
**Asking for Clarification**:
'I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand. Could you clarify?'
'Could you elaborate on [point]?'
'What exactly do you mean by [word/phrase]?'
'I'm not following. Could you explain that differently?'

00:02:45.000 --> 00:03:00.000
**Asking for Repetition**:
'I'm sorry, could you repeat that?'
'I didn't catch that. Could you say it again?'
'Could you go over that one more time?'

**Requesting More Information**:
'Could you provide more details on [topic]?'
'Do you have any data to support that?'
'What's the timeline for [project]?'

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Remember, it's better to ask than to pretend you understand.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:45.000
'For example, our last product launch benefited from both.'
**Participant 2**: 'I agree with you, but I'm concerned about our cash flow.'
