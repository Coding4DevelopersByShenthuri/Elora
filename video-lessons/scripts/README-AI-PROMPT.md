## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Pronunciation Quality is Critical!
- ⚠️ **Test a 30-second sample FIRST** before generating full video
- ⚠️ Some AI voices sound robotic - if so, try different voice or tool
- ⚠️ For language learning, clarity is more important than realism

### Pause Handling
- If AI tool doesn't support [PAUSE]: Generate without pauses, add later in editing
- If AI tool supports pauses: Use the "with-pauses" version
- You can always add/remove pauses in post-production

### Duration
- Script is ~6 minutes when spoken naturally
- AI generation may take 2-5 minutes to process
- Download time depends on your internet speed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Video sounds robotic
- **Solution**: Try different voice option, or use HeyGen (better quality)

**Problem**: Pronunciation not clear
- **Solution**: Test different voices, consider premium voice option ($5-10)

**Problem**: Video too long/short
- **Solution**: AI may adjust pace - edit in post-production to match target duration

**Problem**: Pauses not working
- **Solution**: Add pauses manually in DaVinci Resolve after generating video
